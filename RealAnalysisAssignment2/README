This is the second homework assigment from MIT's opencourseware version of the Real Analysis course. The assignment is about more of the topological properties of the real line focusing mostly on open and closed sets and introducing the important concept of compactness. Also, the definition and properties of infinite sets such as neighborhoods and limit points are introduced.
